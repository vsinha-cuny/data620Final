    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background** The purpose of building a Topic Model is to uncover the hidden structure of a collection of texts.  The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm used in this project has excellent implementations using the Python Gensim package. The challenge however, is to extract topics of good quality that are clear, segregated and meaningful. Doing so depends heavily on the strategy for text preprocessing that best yields intuition about these topics.  A successful model can be determined by one that can address the interogration of the following items by\n",
    "*(1) Topic prevalence, (2) Topic similarity and (3) Topic interpretation.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "This exercise attempts to develop a meaningful topic model by comparing contents of a corpus at two different time periods and in two different subject areas.  What is of interest to the authors is whether these distinctions show up in a meaningful way in the topics that LDA model generates. To build a meaningful model, documents were reviewed by subject and whether they contributed to meaningful variation in our corpus.  This documents were reviewed for inclusion in an interative trial-and-error manner to get to an interpretable result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Objective** This project uses the LDA topic modeling algorhithm to determine trends and relationships in two academic disciplines: Machine Learning and Behavioral Economics.  There were two particular interests being investigated:\n",
    "    1. When comparing the same subject at different snapshots in time, is there a variation in the topics generated and have they changed signficantly? \n",
    "    2. When comparing two separate subjects, does the expected variation in topics generated discernible?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Our Corpus** The dataset consists of selected papers in these categories primarily drawn from the Arxiv.org academic repository of Cornell University.\n",
    "For the purposes of time comparisons, a corpus has been built consisting of papers from 2 date ranges 2012 and 2018.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** Like clustering, the number of topics or clusters is an output parameter. Topic modeling builds clusters of words rather than clusters of texts. A text is thus a mixture of all the topics, each having a specific weight\n",
